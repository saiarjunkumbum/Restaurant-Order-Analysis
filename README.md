RESTAURANT OPERATION ANALYSIS


The Situation	: I’ve been hired as a Data Analyst for the Taste of World Café, a restaurant that has a diverse menu offerings and serves generous options.

The Assignment : The Taste of the World Café debuted a new menu at the start of the year. I’ve been asked to dig into the customer data to see which menu items are doing well / not well and what the top customers seem to like best 


Objectives:	
1.	Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what’s on the new menu
2.	Explore the order_details table to get an idea of the data that’s been collected
3.	Use both tables to understand how customers are reacting to new menu




Objective 1: Exploring the Items Table
- View the menu_items table and write a query to find the number of items on the menu
- What are the least and most expensive items on the menu?
- How many Italian dishes are on the menu? What are the least and most expensive Italian dishes on the menu?
- How many dishes are in each category? What is the average dish price within each category?



Objective 2:  Explore the Orders Table
- View the order_details table. What is the date range of the table?
-	How many orders were made within this date range? How many items were ordered within this date range?
-	Which orders had the most number of items?
-	How many orders had more than 12 items?


Objective 3:  Analyze Customer Behavior

Goal : The main goal of this whole analysis is to dig into our customer data to first see which menu_items are doing well & also, see what the top customers seem to like the best.
So, now that we’ve explored the menu_items table & order_details table, we’ll be able to answer those questions. 

- Combine the menu_items and order_details tables into a single table
- What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?
-	What were the top 5 orders that spent the most money?
-	View the details of the highest spend order. What insights can you gather from the results?
-	View the details of the top 5 highest spend orders. What insights can you gather from the results?
